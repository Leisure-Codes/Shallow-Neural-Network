# Shallow-Neural-Network
A Shallow Neural Network Using IRIS Dataset for Classifying Species.

## Getting Started 
Everything you need to start running up the project from build to end.

### Prerequisite
~~~
Python 3.5, Numpy & Sklearn
~~~

### How it works (Simple Neural Network) :-
~~~
 Step 1 :- Slicing Required Data
 
 Step 2 :-  Initializing Weights & Bias.
 
 Step 3 :- Defining Activation Function.
 
 Step 4 :- Define Forward Propogation.
 
 Step 5 :- Define Cost Function.
 
 Step 6 :- Backpropogation.
 
 Step 7 :- Updating Parameters.
 
 Step 8 :- Create & Model.
~~~

### Warning!
~~~
You can either consider whole of iris dataset however, dont forget to make changes in Step 1.
